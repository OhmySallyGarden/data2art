This is an easy question, it just takes me less than 3 min to finish it. But I still want to write down the details because we can learn how to write more pythonic way from it.

## Explication

How much times for each char of string J occurs in string S. 

For each char in string J, we only need one for loop to sum each char's frequency in String S.

And we use count function to count the frequency of each char's occurrence.

So, we have the following code: 


```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J, S):
        """
        :type J: str
        :type S: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        J = list(J)
        counts = 0
        for c in J:
            counts += S.count(c)
        return counts
```

What if we do note use the python function `count`, the burst way is:

```python
J = list(J)
counts = 0
for c in S:
    if c in C: 
        count += 1
return counts
```

To be brief:

```python
return sum(if c in J for c in S)
```
## Optimization 

For hash set, it takes $O(1)$ to check if it contains an element. So we can use `set` to reduce the time space of finding the number. Then we have the time complexity $O(M+N)$ in this case.

Here are the code:

```python
J_set = set(J)
return sum(if c in J_set (for c in S))
```

The optional way is using `map`, the logic is the same with first solution:

```python
return sum(map(J.count, S))
```

The map() function executes a specified function for each item in a iterable. [wiki]

So why using map is faster than the first solution? The point is we have to understand the implementation of map.

## Runtime

The runtime for those four solution:

| way | Runtime |
| --- | --- |
|map|  52 ms	|
|set|52 ms	|
|brute|64ms|
|count|80ms|

## Further question 

What is the difference between list and set in python?  When should we use the set structure? What is the implementation of map in python?
